# Pacman Modified
Rip-off of the classic game Pacman. Player is supposed to eat all food items on screen in a given amount of time.
Timer logic yet to be implemented.

The basic concepts of movement, collecting food, etc. were the same, but we modified the aesthetics and look of the character and introduced our own. 
The food have a mind of their own and spread the screen while the player attempts to eat them all in given time.

Although I tried uploading my code on OpenProcessing so that other people could play it online, there seems to be some problems. The movements work fine, although food collection is not working.
